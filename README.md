# Public mirror for zeropussy releases

This is were we host the downloads for the zero ranger repaint! We can't host the full repo since it contains a bunch of steam files that we can't distribute.

## How to download

Get the latest version of the mod [here](https://github.com/Ripazhakgggdkp/zeropussy-releases/releases/latest/download/zeropussy.zip)!

## How to install

Find your zero ranger installation folder on steam, then drag the `data.win` file over the mod's `windows-drag-here` file. The patcher will automatically copy the files from the steam game to the mod folder, where it will be patched. Double click `ZeroRanger.exe` to launch the game.
